Sometimes I solve my daily problems with nifty little apps I write as a leisure activity.

Usually I disclose the source code once I am satisfied with my code quality. Which I fight to be more often.

I am a big functional programming <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> afficionado. Nevertheless, my Android apps are done in Java and <a href="https://kotlinlang.org/">Kotlin</a> and my work mainly is done in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>.

Follow my (strong) opinions about proramming languages in my <a href="/blog.html">blog</a>
