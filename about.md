I studied Environmental Systems Science doing the Natural Science / Technology track at both Technical University of Graz and University of Graz.
Now I am a Pre-Doc member of the Systems Science research group of <a href="http://systems-sciences.uni-graz.at/fuell/">Professor Manfred FÃ¼llsack</a>.
The group is situated at the <a href="https://sis.uni-graz.at">Institute of Systems Sciences, Innovation and Sustainability Research.</a>
