My current research focus is on modelling complex epidemiological systems and future state maximization.
In my <a href="https://online.uni-graz.at/kfu_online/wbabs.showThesis?pThesisNr=82349&pOrgNr=1#">PhD-thesis</a> I developed a traffic model that outperforms others in terms of computing time.

Methodologically, I focus on networks analysis and microscopical modelling approaches in the realm of Monte Carlo and agent-based simulation.
