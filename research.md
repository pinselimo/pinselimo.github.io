My current research focus is on traffic modelling and future state maximisation.
Our <a ghref="http://systems-sciences.uni-graz.at/fuell/">working group</a> developed a traffic model that outperforms others in terms of computing time.

Methodologically I am focused on networks analysis and microscopical modelling approaches in the realm of Monte Carlo and Agent-based simulation.
