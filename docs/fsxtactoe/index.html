        <p class="game--description">
        This is a little tic tac toe game against an agent utilizing option maximization.
        
        The game runs completely in your browser as JavaScript engine.
        The algorithm is similar to that used in <a href="">my IIASA YSSP report</a>.
        There is no learning and this is not an AI in the classical sense.

        Note that in any game a winning move would minimize the number of options.
        The agent's algorithm is, therefore, rather unfit for winning a game.
        To make it more competitive the algorithm in the game favors winning states.
        You may notice that its eager to win sometimes makes it do stupid things.
        Click <a href="./gameNoWin.html">here</a> to play against an algorithm that doesn't care about winning.

        The real strength of option maximization strategies lies, however, in uncertain environments.
        Choose the complex game mode to try it out.
        In the complex mode you play in a larger 4x4 arena.
        After every move there is a certain chance of a random field being disabled.
        This field is then taken out of the game and cannot be used for a winning move.
        The agent takes this uncertainty into account - can you?
