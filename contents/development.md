Sometimes I solve my daily problems with nifty little apps I write as a leisure activity.
Most of my code is free and open source. Find my projects on <a href="https://github.com/pinselimo">Github <i class="fab fa-github"></i></a>.

I am a big functional programming <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> aficionado. Nevertheless, my teaching mainly is done in <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a>. To facilitate bridging the gap in between both languages for my students I developed <a href="https://github.com/pinselimo/Pythas">Pythas</a>.
