<p style="font-size: 40px;">Welcome internet traveller <br> you've entered BEHAVIOUR.space <br> the site of <a href="/contents/about.html">Simon Plakolb</a></p>

<h3>Recent Blog Posts</h3>

<p>Occasionally I sit down and finish one of many blog post drafts. The most recent of which are listed here for your convenience:</p>

$partial("templates/post-list.html")$

<p>Just don't take any of those too seriously! If you like the read find more <a href="/contents/blog.html">here</a>.</p>

<h3>For the curious</h3>

<p>You may wonder why this site is hosted under this particular URL. <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/">NetLogo</a> is a program which significantly contributed to my field of systems science. Its sensitivity analysis mode is called "behavior space". Unfortunately, the American spelled URL came with a premium price tag, so here we are at <a href="https://behaviour.space">BEHAVIOUR.space</a>.</p>
